# Portfolio & Simple Storage

Hey! This is my Week 1 project. It's a personal portfolio website that also includes a simple decentralized app (dApp).

**Live Demo:** [https://pranavrai.vercel.app](https://pranavrai.vercel.app)

## What it does
- **Portfolio:** Introduces me and links to my socials.
- **Simple Storage:** You can connect your MetaMask wallet and store a number on the Sepolia testnet!

## How to run it locally
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Use the "Live Server" extension to "Go Live".
3. Connect your MetaMask wallet (make sure you're on Sepolia).
